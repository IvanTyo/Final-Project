# Final Project

Final Project Notes.

For my final project I would like to do something simple; since it's been taking me a while to understand some of the concepts in programming. I was thinking about a webpage that collects fan's information from the artist perspective, might be something that I can incorporate in my own web page; I do have a web page within my website that collects some information but I would like to try to build something more custom.

In this case it would be and internal database; the users are going to be new and existing fans of an independent artist; and they might want to register with the artist because they like their music and they would like to obtain free merchandise, free tickets to a concert and be aware of the artist calendar of shows; it should be a very simple process.

In this case the technology needed would be very simple; just access to a browser, in any computer or mobile devise.


Database is loading fine in the browser, but the submit button is not working properly, this button is suppose to INSERT a new instance into my local database; but so far is not working.
